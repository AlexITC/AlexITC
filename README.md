### üöÄ **About Me**

I got into programming the hard way; learning Assembler by myself to reverse engineer the firmware from Sony Ericsson mobile devices in an environment with no one to ask for help. Since then, I have been in love with programming and I have worked with a lot of programming languages and technologies.

By now, I have been **Programming for 18+ years** where:

* I have worked with many programming languages (Scala, Java, C, Assembler, Ruby, Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript),
* I come from the era where jQuery's, Java Applets, J2ME, and Java Server Pages were normal; evolving with the ecosystem (yes, even Blockchain and AI).
* I have self-hosted many services personally and professionally, including web servers to SMTP servers.
* I have worked extensibely with Blockchain (on Self-Sovereign Identity and cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana), building/designing protocols, self-hosting infrastructure (like bitcoind), and, indexing its data.
* I have spoke in multiple international conferences from the United Kingdom, Poland, France, Spain, and, Mexico.
* While I'm familiar with all the necessary details to launch products and create a business, I have failed at the sales process multiple times.


### **Specific projects**

- I'm working on [geminilive4s](https://github.com/AlexITC/geminilive4s): A library to use Gemini Live API on Scala.
- I built [twimini-bot](https://github.com/AlexITC/twimini-bot): A bot connecting Gemini Live API to voice calls through Twilio: 
- I contributed considerably to the [GCP Batch backend](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cromwell/tree/develop/supportedBackends/google/batch/src) [Cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/latest/backends/GCPBatch/).
- I handled the forking process from the [Snowplow](https://snowplow.io/) components into [OpenSnowcat](https://github.com/opensnowcat) after Snowplow's license change.
- I have restored many legacy service like [Kestrel](https://github.com/twitter-archive/kestrel) from 2009, which is detailed in this talk: [Welcome to Scala 2.7.7... in 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJxEXAkxD3I)
- I have worked extensively with Scala where I created a template for building fullstack apps with Scala and Scala.js: [scala-webapp-template](https://github.com/wiringbits/scala-webapp-template).
* I built a cryptocurrency block explorer supporting Bitcoin + its forks, when I maintained this, it had a 2TB postgres database just for Bitcoin (but it indexed multiple coins): [block-explorer](https://github.com/wiringbits/block-explorer).
* I used to work with Browser Extensions, then, I created a template: [chrome-scalajs-template](https://github.com/AlexITC/chrome-scalajs-template).

There are many blog posts from me at the [Wiringbits blog](https://wiringbits.net) which mention more projects, it also includes lots of testimonials from my work.
